<pre class="container-fluid align border border-danger" >A paragraph is a group of words put together


   to form a group that is usually longer than a


    sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of


     several sentences. There are usually


      between three and eight sentences.


       Paragraphs can begin with an indentation


        (about five spaces), or by missing a


         line out, and then starting again.


          This makes it easier to see when





           one paragraph ends and another
            begins.

    In most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence . 
    This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will 
    be about. Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a t
    hesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay.
    



    Paragraphs may signal when
    
    
    
    
    
    the writer changes topics. Each paragraph may have 

    a number of sentences, depending on the topic.
    
    A pilcrow mark (¶) is sometimes used to show where

    a paragraph begins.
